							<p>Nikole was born in central Washington and spent most of her life in the greater Seattle area. During this time, she pursued her education through school and college, earning two associate degrees while also working for several prominent companies in the region. She has since returned to central Washington, where she is currently working toward her third associate degree in Software Development.</p>

									<h3>Art</h3>
								</header>
								<p>While enrolled in a college art course, Nikole was given a take-home project that would become a defining moment in her artistic journey. That evening, she noticed a hibiscus filet crochet panel hanging in her kitchen window and told her mother that she needed the same pattern, doubled in size, for her assignment. The piece was crocheted by Joy, then carefully stretched over large wooden dowels and framed to resemble a window.</p>

								<p>Nikole painted the finished piece a vibrant crimson. During its unveiling, the professor chose to present the work to the entire class, commenting that it was more representative of a thesis-level piece than a freshman project. The professor even discussed the possibility of exhibiting the work in a women’s health center. This pivotal experience marked the beginning of Nikole’s exploration of unconventional materials and solidified her belief that art can be created through any medium.</p>

								<p>The Filet Crochet Paintings honor the past by preserving the traditional art of filet crocheting while reimagining it in a contemporary context. Using filet crochet as a canvas transforms the medium into something both familiar and unexpected, inviting viewers to recognize beauty in all facets of life.</p>

									<h3>Video Games</h3>

								<p>I have a deep appreciation for The Legend of Zelda and play it whenever I have the opportunity. Even spending an entire birthday immersed in the game various games. For anyone who hasn’t experienced it, I highly recommend it. The creativity, immersive worlds, and engaging puzzles make it both exciting and endlessly enjoyable.</p>
